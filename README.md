# Digit-Guesser
A multilayer perceptron that can detect single digits.

## Project status
Not usable. It's in the early stages.
## How to use

Draw a digit on the drawing board, then press the start button.
The network then should detect the number.
In the result section, the network will output (hopefully) the drawn digit.
