# Digit-Guesser
A multilayer perceptron that can detect single digits.

## Preview (Network is still untrained)

## Project status
W.I.P
The user can draw digits, but the network isn't working properly yet.
## How to use

Draw any digit on the drawing board.
Press the start button.
The network then should detect the number.
In the result section, the network will output (hopefully) the drawn digit.
